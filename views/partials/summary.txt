Since I was a kid I always wanted to make an impact on this planet by creating something that would help people and bring them together. 
When I found out about programming and how powerful this tool is, I immediately fell in love with it. It quickly became a passion for me. 
I decided to attend Concordia University to pursue a degree in Software Engineering in order to gain more knowledge of the field.
Currently working on small projects and learning new high-level languages, my goal would be to work alongside a team of individuals who share
the same passion as me and build innovative tools and technologies.
