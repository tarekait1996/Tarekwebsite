					Since I was a kid I always wanted to create something that could help people and bring them together. 
					When I found out about programming and how powerful this tool can be, I immediately fell in love with it and it quickly became my passion. 
					I decided to attend Concordia University to pursue a degree in Software Engineering in order to gain more knowledge of the field.
					Currently working on small projects and learning new high-level languages, my goal would be to work alongside a team of individuals who share
					the same passion as me and build innovative tools and technologies.
